# Angle Core

This directory contains angle's core. It was originally extracted as a part of
the work for [RFC 7072] and is a collection of the bits and pieces you'd need to
make a angle. That is, `core` is not angle with parts missing but foundational
material to build a angle from.

The work done here so far is very preliminary.

[RFC 7072]: https://github.com/khulnasoft/angle/blob/fc3799ba83a7e67fde5b23729556174bf5e057eb/rfcs/2021-04-13-7027-core-extraction.md
