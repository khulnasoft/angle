Although Angle is primarily used to handle observability data from a wide variety of sources, we also strive to
make Angle highly observable itself. To that end, Angle provides two [sources], [`internal_logs`][internal_logs] and
[`internal_metrics`][internal_metrics], that you can use to handle logs and metrics produced by Angle just like you
would logs and metrics from any other source.

## Logs

Angle provides clear, informative, well-structured logs via the [`internal_logs`][internal_logs] source. This section
shows you how to use them in your Angle topology.

*Which* logs Angle pipes through the `internal_logs` source is determined by the [log level](#levels), which defaults
to `info`.

In addition to the `internal_logs` source, Angle also writes its logs to [`stderr`][stderr], which can be captured by
Kubernetes, SystemD, or however you are running Angle.

### Accessing logs

You can access Angle's logs by adding an [`internal_logs`][internal_logs] source to your [topology]. Here's an example
configuration that takes Angle's logs and pipes them to the console as plain text:

```toml
[sources.angle_logs]
type = "internal_logs"

[sinks.console]
type = "console"
inputs = ["angle_logs"]
encoding.codec = "text"
```

### Using Angle logs

Once Angle logs enter your topology through the `internal_logs` source, you can treat them like logs from any other
system, i.e. you can [transform] them and send them off to any number of [sinks]. The configuration below, for example,
transforms Angle's logs using the [`remap` transform][remap] and [Angle Remap Language][VRL] and then stores those
logs in [ClickHouse]:

```toml
[sources.angle_logs]
type = "internal_logs"

[transforms.modify]
type = "remap"
inputs = ["angle_logs"]

# Reformat the timestamp to Unix time
source = '''
  .timestamp = to_unix_timestamp!(to_timestamp!(.timestamp))
'''

[sinks.database]
type = "clickhouse"
inputs = ["modify"]
host = "http://localhost:8123"
table = "angle-log-data"
```

### Configuring logs

#### Levels

Angle logs at the `info` level by default. You can set a different level when [starting] up your instance using either
command-line flags or the `ANGLE_LOG` environment variable. The table below details these options:

Method | Description
:------|:-----------
`-v` flag | Drops the log level to `debug`
`-vv` flag | Drops the log level to `trace`
`-q` flag | Raises the log level to `warn`
`-qq` flag | Raises the log level to `error`
`-qqq` flag | Disables logging
`ANGLE_LOG=<level>` environment variable | Set the log level. Must be one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `off`.

#### Stack traces

You can enable full error backtraces by setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` environment variable. More on this in the
[Troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting].

## Metrics

You can monitor metrics produced by Angle using the [`internal_metrics`][internal_metrics] source. As with Angle's
[internal logs](#using-angle-logs), you can configure an `internal_metrics` source and use the piped-in metrics
however you wish. Here's an example configuration that delivers Angle's metrics to a Prometheus remote write endpoint.

```toml
[sources.angle_metrics]
type = "internal_metrics"

[sinks.prometheus]
type = ["prometheus_remote_write"]
endpoint = ["https://localhost:8087/"]
inputs = ["angle_metrics"]
```

### Metrics catalogue

The table below provides a list of internal metrics provided by Angle. See the docs for the [`internal_metrics`
source][output] for more detailed information about the available metrics.

## How it works

### Event-driven observability

Angle employs an event-driven observability strategy that ensures consistent and correlated telemetry data. You can
read more about our approach in [RFC 2064][rfc_2064].

### Log rate limiting

Angle rate limits log events in the hot path. This enables you to get granular insight without the risk of saturating
IO and disrupting the service. The trade-off is that repetitive logs aren't logged.
