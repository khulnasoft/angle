// This file establishes the Angle repo as a CUE module that can be imported by
// other CUE libraries. This is here largely so that the CUE team can use the
// the Angle docs as an integration test case. See
// https://github.com/khulnasoft/angle/pull/6593. This currently has no effect
// on the Angle docs build.
